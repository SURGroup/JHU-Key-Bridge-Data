- PDF files showing the distribution of ship sizes passing under specific bridges.

<ins>Further details can be found in the README file within that folder.</ins>

### Raw Ship Traffic Data
- CSV files containing ship traffic data under individual bridges; these files were used to create the plots in "Bridge Ranking by Ship Traffic" and "Distribution of Ship Size for Individual Bridges".

#### Cumulative Jan 2018 - Mar 2024 Ship Traffic
- CSV files containing the total number of trips (January 2018 - March 2024) and the average number of trips per day for all bridges studied. These files were used to create the plots in "Bridge Ranking by Ship Traffic".
